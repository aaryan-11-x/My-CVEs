5) Access the Shell
Visit `/admin/img/vehicleimages/shell.php?cmd=whoami` to execute system commands.

# Root Cause
The application does not validate file types or restrict uploads to specific file extensions like .jpg or .png. This allows attackers to upload executable PHP scripts.

# Impact
An attacker can:
- Execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- Gain full control of the application and underlying server.
- Compromise sensitive user and application data.
