# Description
A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the edit-vehicle.php endpoint of the Online Car Rental System. The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious JavaScript payloads into the vehicalorcview parameter, which gets executed when an admin or user views the injected content.

# Vulnerability Details
Endpoint: `/admin/edit-vehicle.php`
Affected Parameter: `vehicalorcview`
Impact: Persistent execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

# Steps to Reproduce
1) Login as Admin: Use valid admin credentials to access the admin dashboard.
2) Enter the XSS Payload in the **vehicalorcview** parameter:
![[XSS - 1 1.png]]

3) Trigger the Payload: Visit /index.php
![[XSS - 2.png]]

# Root Cause
The application fails to sanitize or escape user input before rendering it in the output. Specifically, the following vulnerable line in `/index.php` directly echoes the user input:
```php
<p><?php echo substr($result->VehiclesOverview,0,70);?></p>
```


# Impact
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:
- Steal sensitive information such as session cookies.
- Redirect users to malicious sites.
- Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the userâ€™s browser.
